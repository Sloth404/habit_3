## Project Title

**Habit³** – The Minimalist Habit-Tracking App

## Short Description

Habit³ is a minimalist tracking app for the sustainable development of habits. It intentionally limits the number of habits to a maximum of three to reduce feelings of overwhelm and potential setbacks. The app aims to simplify goal adherence through graphs and targeted reminders.

## Motivation

Overzealous goal setting and cluttered apps can quickly lead to abandoning new habits. Habit³ addresses this issue through intentional minimalism, gentle feedback loops, and a clearly limited app structure.
